Use a different validator instead of mongoose (perhaps validator.js/express-validator)
Rename name property of forms and listings to title for consistency
Do not allow form fields to have duplicate titles
Rename fields without losing data
    - Fields will require ids so must be stored separately from forms
Reorder form field
    - Add move up and move down button below fields list that move the selected field
    - Send the fields in the order they appear to the server
    - The server updates field.order based on the index of the field in the array
    - Whenever the server fetches the field, it order them based on their order property
Reorder listing columns
    - Same algorithm as form fields
Relationships between forms (get select options from form data)
    - If field.type is options, ask the user if they want to source the data from another form
    - If not, let them type in option values as they do now
    - Otherwise, select a form and field
Add file upload field type
    - If dev, save locally
    - else, save on S3
    - File type and size validation
Add markdown field type
    - Will need a angular and node/express/jade friendly markdown editor
Filter listing
    - Only show certain rows of listing based on certain field values
Pagination for listing
    - Limit amount of items shown in listing by specifying page size
Present listing by in list by specifying a custom template
    - User selects fields to show in listing
    - User selects list format (as opposed to current tabular format)
    - User select how each field is represented by choosing options (element type, size, etc.)
Authentication
    - Lock down whole or part of app behind a login
    - Requires a way to register user
    - Let admin decide to allow open registration (with or without approval)
    - Let admin manage users (activation, password resets)
Authorization
    - Mark certain pages as accessible by certain roles
    - Admin manages roles
Create pages
    - Pages are made up of forms and/or listings
    - Will allow for blog post with comment and form for adding a comment
Theming
    - Select a theme
    - Can start with templates from bootswatch that will simply replace bootstrap.css
    - Allow for custom css and completely turning off bootstrap
